## Things to
- Add UI for when a promo is done as at the moment only the UI will re-render if the promo happpens and making clear that there is no promo applied will be a better UX I think.
- Optimise dotenv config (development, product config)
- Add BDDs
- Add CI/CD for automated build and deployment 'somewhere'
- Instructions and test cases do not seem to be correct (case 1 & case 2) as there is only one rule for the strawberries discount
